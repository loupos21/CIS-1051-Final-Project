Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

For this project, all of the photos have been imported. Using CSS and bootstrap, I was able to create carousels for each photoshoot and create separate pages for them. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not yet been able to finalize the style/design of the website as I am still organizing the homepage and drop down menu. In addition, I have not yet set up the domain.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

At first, it was quite overwhelming because I did not take the process step by step and rushed into the designing part without putting much consideration towards the html portion. This led me to have difficulty trying to organize the pages and images in addition to resizing the images.
