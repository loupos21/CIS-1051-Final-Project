One major issue I came across that I did not mention in the video was creating an offical domain for the website. In the future I hope to buy a domain and enchance the website in a more organized and professional manner.
Overall, alhtough I have experienced many obstacles creating this website, I was able to aquire new skills such as HTML and CSS coding and have a faimiliarity when I take the class. Creating a website about something I am passionate about made the experience more enjoyable that I am able to share my passion through a website I have created from watching multiple tutorials. In addition, the process was very interesting learning how websites work because you really get the behind the scenes of only the basics too and it shows the intensity of coding on how coding a website is not just a few lines, but involve multiple files that include all sores of coding languages such as html and css.
